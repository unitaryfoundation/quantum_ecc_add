# Autoresearch Ideas Backlog

- **Direct controlled-constant Solinas corrections:** `KAL_DIRECT_CONST_HALVE=1` is clean and gives `4,121,014 @ 2715q` by replacing the loaded 256q constant register in modular halve with `csub_nbit_const_direct_fast`; default remains `4,111,918 @ 2716q`. Standalone direct cadd/csub basis+phase tests pass. The add analogue (`KAL_DIRECT_CONST_DOUBLE=1`) fails at the aggressive 375 bulk prefix with `altseed_classical_total=1`, `altseed_phase_batches_total=2`, but is clean with `KAL_BULK3_ITERS=370` at `4,121,506 @ 2716q`. It is a tested env-gated tool, not a default optimization. Next low-qubit target after direct halve is `bk_step4` tmp/carry transient.

- `by_denominator_branch_history_self_cleans_on_reverse` proves a constructive BY branch-history shape: a 64-step/96-bit denominator pass stores odd/A history, then reverse denominator restores f,g,delta and clears odd/A from the restored pre-step state, phase clean (87,808 CCX, peak 524q). This means branch history does not need a separate compute-copy-uncompute oracle; it can be generated while consuming denominator and erased while restoring it. `lowword_pattern_oracle_is_cheap_and_clean` isolates one 16-step window branch oracle: copy low f/g, emit odd pattern, CNOT to history, reverse local simulator; 5,952 CCX, peak 122q, exact/phase-clean. So pattern generation is cheap. But `full_width_denominator_microstep_window_replay_is_not_enough` measures the straightforward selected full-width denominator replay: 26,256 CCX/window, 35-window compute≈918,960, compute+uncompute≈1,837,920, peak 1128q. Need selected/fixed-matrix denominator window with algebraic sharing (~8k/window target), or consumed-denominator schedule; per-bit full-width window replay is not enough. `tapered_fixed_matrix_denominator_budget_is_sota_shaped_if_selection_solved` gives the positive target if selection is solved: tapered 35-window denominator compute≈303,828 CCX mean, max 329,595, compute+uncompute≈607,657; Toffoli-shaped, but naive standalone peak 3424q due old/new buffers. `consumed_lowword_window_has_exact_quotient_update_and_pattern_inverse` gives the window algebra: with `f=f_low+2^16F`, `g=g_low+2^16G`, selected `P` updates quotient by `P·(F,G)+(P·low)/2^16`; sampled lowword correction |q|≤32757, and pattern+full quotient reconstructs old via scaled adjugate. `lowword_pattern_and_q_oracle_is_still_cheap_and_clean` realizes the local side-information oracle: sign-extend low words, run 16 signed divsteps, copy pattern and q0/q1, reverse clean; 9,408 CCX, peak 262q, qbits=34. `fixed_precision_2adic_denominator_branch_curve` kills field-width truncation as an approximate shortcut: 64..256-bit states mismatch essentially 100% of 560-step trajectories, first mismatch around bits+1.
- `reversible_pattern_delta_decoder_matches_and_cleans` upgrades the BY A-control decoder from budget to circuit: one 16-step window `(pattern,delta_start,A=0)->(pattern,delta_next,A_mask)` costs 1,776 CCX forward / 3,552 roundtrip, peak 53q, exact and phase-clean using exact small delta arithmetic. 35 forward decodes≈62,160, within the 150k integration margin. `scaled_by_pattern_decoder_560_tagged_div_scaffold_is_clean` wraps the full 560-step tagged-DIV replay with forward decoders and reverse decoders: decode=62,160, replay+decode=1,207,920, roundtrip clean=1,270,080 CCX, peak 2,415q, A history cleaned and delta restored. `window_local_a_clear_fails_phase_with_mbu_microsteps` tries the lower-scratch 16-A-window + 350 boundary-delta schedule: classical tagged-DIV data correct and peak 2,221q, but phase=1 because current MBU modular microsteps cannot have controls cleared early. `exact_scaled_microstep_is_phase_safe_but_too_expensive_for_window_local_clear` measures the obvious exact fix: exact microstep 4,350 CCX vs fast 2,046, exact 560 replay≈2.436M, too high. Production replay needs all A live or a surgical phase-fix/self-cleaning window, not wholesale exact modular arithmetic. New surgical phase/cost lead: `live_reduction_flag_microstep_hits_replay_target_but_needs_cleanup` keeps the modular-add reduction flag live instead of running the MBU comparator uncompute, giving 1,790 CCX/step and replay560≈1,002,400. `live_reduction_flags_make_window_local_a_clear_phase_safe_candidate` uses those live flags with window-local A clearing: data correct, A/delta clean, phase=0, 1,126,720 CCX, peak 2,780q, but leaves 560 reduction flags dirty. Production replay now needs reduction-flag cleanup/absorption. `live_reduction_flag_is_recoverable_from_doubled_output_but_cleanup_is_costly` proves the canonical recovery relation `flag = odd && (2*out_s mod p) < r_out` (only fast-negation zero representative mismatches), but direct cleanup needs doubled-output copy + comparator + uncompute, ≈766 CCX/flag, worse than the skipped cmp_lt. `live_reduction_flag_history_is_dense_and_high_entropy` kills sparse position-list cleanup: actual tagged-DIV trajectories have mean true flags≈133.8/560, p99=155, independent entropy≈436.1 bits. Stronger representation lead: `redundant_signed_scaled_by_replay_avoids_reduction_flags_algebraically` skips modular reduction before halve using signed reps `(T+(T&1)p)/2`; 2000 secp samples exact modulo p, max magnitude≤2p, but parity_mean≈276.5/560 and entropy≈559 bits. `redundant_signed_microstep_is_cheap_if_parity_history_can_be_cleaned` gives a 260-bit circuit at 1,297 CCX/step, replay560≈726,320, peak 1,043q, leaving only dense parity history. This is below fixed-control replay cost if parity can be cleaned/absorbed. `centered_signed_redundant_replay_stays_within_half_modulus` improves the representative discipline: add/subtract p on odd pre-halve values according to sign, exact on 2000 secp samples, max magnitude uses only 255 bits (<p), parity_mean≈264.9/560. Centered reps make a narrow signed circuit plausible, but parity cleanup remains the hard part. `centered_signed_microstep_keeps_narrow_reps_at_submillion_cost` synthesizes the sign-conditioned centered microstep at 1,560 CCX (replay560≈873,600, peak 1,046q). `centered_signed_560_scaffold_hits_submillion_replay_with_live_parity` composes all 560 steps: 873,600 CCX, peak 2,723q, exact/phase-clean, parity dirty. `centered_parity_is_recoverable_from_poststate_range_for_add_cases` shows parity is range-recoverable from poststate on centered inputs (`B: !(2s-r centered)`, `A: !(r-2s centered)`, `C: !(2s centered)`), but `naive_centered_parity_recovery_cost_would_erase_redundant_replay_win` measures ≈1,296 CCX/flag, ≈725,760 for 560 flags. Need fold parity range recovery into inverse/window arithmetic, not clean post-hoc. `centered_signed_inverse_560_product_clean_scaffold_matches_forward_cost` gives inverse/product-clean at the same 873,600 CCX / peak 2,722q. `centered_signed_replay_budget_hits_google_if_parity_and_denominator_are_folded` projects scaffold≈285,766 + 2×centered replay≈1,747,200 + 2×selected denominator≈607,656 => ≈2,640,622 if parity is folded; naive parity cleanup projects ≈4,092,142. `centered_parity_highbits_recovery_is_too_approximate_without_boundary_fix` kills pure high-bit range recovery (65,709/1,120,000 = 5.87% mismatches), though `highbits_centered_parity_recovery_cost_is_plausible_if_folded` shows the cheap target is ≈524 CCX/B-flag if boundary correction can be made exact. `BY_CENTERED_REPLAY_BODY_BENCH=1` wires the 873.6k centered body into the real benchmark harness as a clean no-op smoke hook: avg_toffoli=4,985,518, qubits=2,716, emitted_ops=38,874,541, all altseed/phase/ancilla checks clean; default remains 4,111,918. Tried a stronger nonzero forward+inverse centered roundtrip harness hook that cleared parity from restored rows; it was classically/ancilla clean but initially failed phase. Root cause was the inverse centered unhalve: add/sub controls were computed from the doubled value's sign but uncomputed from the post-correction sign, which flips when parity=1. Keeping a one-qubit `sign_hist` through unhalve fixes the dirty controls. After the fix, `centered_signed_roundtrip_parity_clear_is_phase_clean_with_exact_controls` shows all 96-step variants phase-clean, including fast MBU controls (299,616 CCX, phase=0). `centered_signed_fast_signed_phase_after_exact_parity_controls_is_clean_after_unhalve_fix` sees only phase 0 across 12 full-560 exact-parity/fast-signed samples. `centered_clean_roundtrip_fixed_trace_for_benchmark_hook_is_phase_clean` validates the fixed raw-control benchmark trace. The requested all-exact hook is now wired as `BY_CENTERED_CLEAN_ROUNDTRIP_BENCH=1`: avg_toffoli=7,311,738, qubits=2,976, emitted_ops=42,092,380, all altseed/phase/ancilla clean. It uses KAL_BULK3_ITERS=370 by default under that env flag only, because the huge hook changes the circuit hash enough to hit a rare phase cliff in the old 375-prefix Kaliski scaffold. This is not SOTA-shaped, but it proves clean centered forward+inverse/parity-clear can live in the real harness and reopens the fast MBU cleanup path. `BY_CENTERED_FAST_CLEAN_ROUNDTRIP_BENCH=1` now wires the fast MBU clean roundtrip too: avg_toffoli=5,860,218, qubits=3,235, emitted_ops=47,024,860, all clean. This is still Kaliski + appended BY no-op, but the increment is ≈1.748M = two 873.6k centered replays plus tiny parity cleanup, proving the fast body can be cleaned in the production harness with corrected unhalve. `BY_CENTERED_DENOM_CONTROLS_BENCH=1` now adds the first denominator-derived control hook: copy live quantum output-x into a 560-bit 2-adic denominator state, generate BY odd/A controls, run the clean fast centered replay roundtrip on zero scratch, reverse the denominator generator to clear controls, and uncopy the denominator. Harness passes: avg_toffoli=7,868,378, qubits=4,964, emitted_ops=55,824,052, all clean. This is very wide/expensive and still appended no-op, but controls are now genuinely derived from live quantum denominator data. `BY_CENTERED_LIVE_NUM_BENCH=1` adds a live numerator-derived signed scratch too: centered-copy live quantum y into replay s, run the same denominator-derived fast clean roundtrip, uncenter and uncopy y. Harness passes: avg_toffoli=7,870,438, qubits=4,965, emitted_ops=55,834,807, all clean. Next step is to stop reversing the replay as a no-op: run pair1 forward to write tagged quotient, or pair2 inverse to write product-clean channel, then delete corresponding Kaliski/mul piece. `BY_CENTERED_PAIR1_REPLACE=1` now does the first real replacement: pair1 Kaliski + pair1 mul1 are replaced by a 576-step full-width signed BY tagged-DIV Bennett computation that writes `lam=-dy/dx`, then existing pair1 mul2 zeros `ty`; pair2 remains Kaliski. Harness passes: avg_toffoli=8,172,700, qubits=5,589, emitted_ops=51,801,485, all altseed/phase/ancilla clean. The 560-step version had one main-shot miss, so 576 is the current harness-safe setting. `BY_CENTERED_PAIR2_REPLACE=1` now replaces pair2 Kaliski too: compute `-(ty/tx)` with centered BY and add directly into live `lam` (no dirty quotient output); harness passes avg_toffoli=8,189,908, qubits=5,589, emitted_ops=51,930,771, all clean. Both flags together pass: avg_toffoli=12,251,174, qubits=5,589, emitted_ops=72,970,707. Fast MBU cmod add/sub for quotient accumulation is also phase-clean and slightly improves these probes: pair1=8,171,417, pair2=8,187,601, both=12,246,560. Attempting to make the signed-to-modular copy correction fast caused one phase-garbage batch, so keep that correction exact. `BY_CENTERED_WINDOW_DENOM_REPLACE=1` now wires the 16-step lowword/window denominator-control oracle into the actual quotient-producing pair replacements: each window uses a 34-bit signed local 2-adic simulator to source odd/A controls, then applies those controls to the full-width signed denominator state so final `sign(f)` is preserved. Pair1 window-controls pass at 8,790,041 Toffoli, pair2 at 8,806,225, and both together at 13,483,808, all clean. `BY_CENTERED_WINDOW_Q_DENOM_REPLACE=1` now also persists the 34-bit signed q0/q1 correction rows from every 16-step local simulator through the real quotient replay and clears them by rerunning the lowword oracle: pair1=8,790,041 @8037q, pair2=8,806,225 @8037q, both=13,483,808 @8037q, all clean. Toffoli is unchanged because q copyout is CNOT-only; +2448q is the raw 2×36×34 q-history bank. This is worse than the direct generator because it still performs 576 full-width selected microsteps and adds the oracle; the value is that the selected/window interface now composes in the real affine path. Next delete those full-width per-step applications by consuming q window-locally in the fixed-matrix update. This is worse than baseline but proves BY can replace both Kaliski-sized pieces in the real point-add path. Last-shot ground-up pair2 variant: `BY_SCALED_PAIR2_PRODUCT_REPLACE=1` skips `mul3_between_pair` and pair2 quotient-add entirely; it frames `lam` as `u=-sign(f)*lam` and runs scaled BY inverse/product-clean so `(u,0)->(0,lam*tx)`. Harness passes at 8,038,619 Toffoli / 4,236q / 49,073,481 emitted ops, clean. This beats the centered pair2 quotient replacement shape (8,187,601 / 5,589q) and validates product-clean BY in the affine path, but it is still far above default because direct 576-step denominator compute/uncompute dominates. Conclusion: product-clean replay is viable; BY SOTA now depends entirely on selected/window/consumed denominator generation. New early invalidation: `consumed_denominator_window_branchless_recovery_is_exponentially_ambiguous` kills the tempting branchless consumed-denominator cleanup. From poststate `(delta,f,g)=(0,1,0)`, a 16-step reverse window has 589,824 valid predecessor branch patterns/states, so branch controls cannot be recovered from the consumed denominator alone. Any viable BY denominator must carry compressed pattern history or consume pattern+q in a reversible fixed-matrix window with an explicit local inverse; no-history poststate recovery is dead. Final constructive fixed-window attempt: `last_shot_fixed_matrix_window_consumption_misses_sota_budget` costs the actual reversible fixed-matrix/q window object we know how to synthesize (scaled rows + old-row cleanup + m/q/z cleanup). It measures mean=20,323.5 CCX/window, p90=24,382, max=27,641, max_peak=2,224q; two 576-step denominators project ≈1,463,292 CCX, while the SOTA-shaped target is ≈10k/window. This misses by ~2× per window before replay/scaffold costs. With current arithmetic primitives, BY fixed-window denominator generation is not SOTA-shaped; a BY revival would need a genuinely new selected-window arithmetic primitive, not more integration wiring. If that cannot be made real, BY is dead for SOTA.

- Potential BY replay-cost breakthrough: fuse `cmod_add_qq(s,r,odd)` followed by `mod_halve(s)` into one reversible controlled modular average `s <- (s + odd*r)/2`. Irreversible case split is `T=s+odd*r`; if `T` is even output `T/2`, if odd output `(T+p)/2` for `T<p` or `(T-p)/2` for `T>=p`. A clean circuit must recover the modular-add carry from the final doubled output (analogous to `mod_add_qq_fast`'s `cmp_lt` flag recovery). If this removes one full modular-add correction per BY microstep, each replay could drop well below 1.145M. `clean_two_replay_by_budget_requires_replay_or_phase_breakthrough` shows why this is mandatory: with current clean decoded replays, 2×clean replay + deleted-phase scaffold≈2,825,926 before branch generation; even forward-only decoded replay is≈2,701,606. Fixed-control replay target (≈800,900 each) plus 300k branch would be≈2,187,566, so the replay gap is now the main moonshot lever. `quantum_branch_values_do_not_reduce_replay_toffoli_accounting` confirms no hidden average-case relief: quantum branch controls do not reduce benchmark Toffoli; fast replay mean per shot equals static 1,145,760.

## Current State (2026-04-28)
- Best/default exact: **4,111,918 Toffoli @ 2716 qubits**, phase-robust (bulk prefix raised to 375; 377 fails phase).
- SOTA target: **2.7M Toffoli @ 1175 qubits** low-qubit and **2.1M @ 1425q** low-gate (Babbush-Zalcman-Gidney et al., arXiv:2603.28846 / Google ZKP).
- Gap: **1.41M Toffoli**, **~1540 qubits** to low-qubit target.
- Already beats published HRSL 2020 (~12M) and Kim 2026 (~17M) by 3-4×; Google circuit remains withheld.

## 2026-04-28 structural status update (do not lose)
- **Post-BY Strategy E slope-coordinate attempt**: new non-BY affine map validated in `single_inv_numeric.rs`: `m=dy/dx`, `Rx=m^2-dx-2Qx`, `Ry=-m*(Rx-Qx)-Qy`. `strategy_e_slope_coordinate_formula_passes_200` passes 200 random secp256k1 additions. Fast invalidation: current reversible primitives need product-clean/inverse-sized machinery for the required in-place variable multiply `(c,m)->(c,-m*c-Qy)`, so `strategy_e_slope_coordinate_budget_requires_new_inplace_variable_multiply` records current-known≈2,988,510 Toffoli vs ≈2,022,750 only if a schoolbook-like in-place variable multiply exists; needed saving≈965,760. Decision: algebra valid, current circuit route dead; only revive if a genuinely new phase-clean in-place variable multiply/divide primitive appears. First such primitive attempt, `destructive_montgomery_product_is_algebraically_promising_but_not_locally_reversible`, validates forward destructive Montgomery multiplication (`t=x*y*2^-n`) but kills local bit clearing: for p=251,a=173 an 8-bit reachable window poststate has 512 valid `(old_t,bits)` predecessors. Thus consumed multiplier bits need history/checkpoints or a nonlocal inverse; this is not the missing IMUL. Second primitive attempt, `mbuc_product_cleanup_phase_oracle_is_not_low_degree_on_toy_field`, kills cheap MBUC cleanup of the old multiplier: the required phase is a mask bit of `z/x mod p`, and for p=251 its ANF has degree 15/16 and density 32518/65536, so the hoped-for sparse/low-degree phase oracle is absent.
- **Scale-absorption Kaliski probe**: raw Kaliski emits `-v^-1*2^iters`; pre-scaling the denominator by `2^iters` makes the exposed inverse exact and deletes the pair1 halving / pair2 doubling correction loops. Fast generic prescale was classically right but phase-unsafe (`KAL_PRESCALE_PAIR1=1` saw `altseed_phase_batches_total=1`). Phase-clean exact prescale is wired as `KAL_PRESCALE_PAIR1_SAFE=1` / `KAL_PRESCALE_PAIR2_SAFE=1` and passes full harness but is much worse: pair1 `avg_toffoli=4,786,373`, `qubits=2,972`; pair2 `avg_toffoli=4,771,009`, `qubits=2,969`, both clean. Mixed diagnostic `KAL_PRESCALE_PAIR1_MIXED=1` / `KAL_PRESCALE_PAIR2_MIXED=1` (exact q-q add/sub, fast modular shifts) is clean and much cheaper: pair1 `avg_toffoli=4,223,465`, `qubits=2,972`; pair2 `avg_toffoli=4,220,405`, `qubits=2,969`; both `avg_toffoli=4,331,952`, `qubits=2,972`, so fast shifts are not the phase culprit. `KAL_PRESCALE_PAIR1_FOLDED=1` / `KAL_PRESCALE_PAIR2_FOLDED=1` push the mixed prescaler into Kaliski `v_w` initialization and give the same Toffoli at pair1 `qubits=2,969`, pair2 `qubits=2,965`, saving only 3-4q but proving the right integration point. Conclusion: algebraic lever real, current prescaler still not enough; revisit with a secp256k1-specific phase-clean shifted-add prescaler for sparse `2^iters mod p` (e.g. `2^407=2^151(2^32+977)`) below the mixed overhead and ideally folded into Kaliski `v_w` initialization.
- **One-Kaliski is the Toffoli key**: one `with_kal_inv_raw` invocation costs ~1.60M, so deleting one invocation would put the current primitive stack at roughly **2.5M**, enough to match Google's Toffoli target.
- **But one-Kaliski in-place cleanup remains blocked**: B2 leaks `lam_copy = -λ`; Strategy C (`w=dx³`) is classically correct but needs fresh output/state cleanup equivalent to reconstructing `(Px,Py)` from `(Rx,Ry)`, i.e. another point-subtraction/inversion. This is not just implementation pain.
- **600-scratch reframing**: the needed primitive is not `x^-1` into ancilla; it is clean in-place **DIV**: `(x,y)->(x,y/x)`. If DIV fits in ~600 scratch and ~1 Kaliski invocation, point-add is ~2.4-2.8M.
- **New coefficient-transform probe** (`kaliski_linear_transform.rs`, 3 tests pass): canonical Kaliski coefficient update has `T(dx)=[[a,k],[dx,0]]` with `k*dx=-2^407`; seeding `s=dy` gives `(r,s)=(k*dy,0)` (scaled slope, y consumed). This is the first low-qubit-looking route.
- **Coefficient-transform obstruction is crisp**: before backward to output `Ry`, need `(k*Ry,0)` but have `(k*dy,0)`, so missing update is `k*(Ry-dy)` without raw `k`. Affine shifted-Y conventions do **not** solve it; they leave a `/dx` term.
- **Two-channel affine coefficient search reduced/mostly killed**: with transform `T=[[a,k],[dx,0]]`, target delta is `a(rF-r0)+k(sF-s0)`. If scratch `r` must end as known/freeable and we avoid unknown `a`, then `r0=rF=constant`, reducing exactly to the shifted-Y case. Remaining hope requires making `r` itself an output register or finding a different triangular DIV transform.
- **Output-register `r` route reframed**: if Kaliski forward computes `r=k*y`, then `r` can become final `ty` only if forward Kaliski is self-cleaning (no `m_hist`, no backward). New tests show end-state `(u,v,f)` does not recover branch, full `(u,v,r,s,f)` does on nonzero coefficient samples, but zero coefficient seed loses branch information. Exact DIV needs a nonzero tag or coefficient-independent branch recovery.
- **Approx-tolerant tag breakthrough**: seed coefficient with `s0=y+x`. Since `T(x)*(0,y+x)=(k*y + k*x,0)=(k*y-2^407,0)`, the raw `k*y` quotient is recovered by adding a known constant; the tag-zero exception is `y=-x`, negligible. Test `dx_tagged_seed_recovers_division_with_negligible_exception` passes. Default-off circuit validation `KAL_TAGGED_DIV_VALIDATE=1` also passes 9024 shots + 5 alt seeds at 4,138,926 Toffoli / 2716q (adds ~6k because it still uses old Kaliski). This is the first algebraic tag that doesn't require raw `k`.
- **Naive coefficient side-channel invalidated**: `KAL_TAGGED_DIV_COEFF_CHANNEL=1` carries `(lam,ty)` through live Kaliski controls, consumes `ty` to zero, and passes the harness, but costs 4,672,021 Toffoli / 2,977q. It removes pair1's two schoolbook multiplications but adds per-iteration coeff cswaps+cmodadd+double and keeps the old inverse `(r,s)+m_hist`; too wide/expensive for SOTA. New test `stored_a_and_m_bits_recover_branch_pair` confirms a branch-only scaffold can recover `add` from stored `a` plus existing `m` via `add=f&!(a xor m)`.
- **Branch-stream tagged DIV scaffold works under 2800q but is too expensive**: `KAL_TAGGED_DIV_BRANCH_STREAM=1` records `m_hist+a_hist+add_hist`, frees final denominator `(u,v,f)`, replays histories into `(lam,ty)`, and uncomputes histories. It passes 9024 shots + 5 alt seeds with 0 failures at 4,729,076 Toffoli / 2,763q. `KAL_TAGGED_DIV_BRANCH_TERM=1` compresses `add_hist` to a 9-bit terminal index and passes at 5,267,537 Toffoli / 2,714q; peak is pair2 Kaliski again but per-iter comparators are too costly. `KAL_TAGGED_DIV_BRANCH_TERM_ROLL=1` uses a rolling active flag (`term_idx==i` toggle, one add-control `active&!(a xor m)`) and passes at 4,733,146 Toffoli / 2,714q. This validates clean reversible tagged DIV below the current cap, but stored-history replay is still ~600k Toffoli worse than default. `KAL_PAIR2_BRANCH_INV_ROLL=1` tried to use the same branch-history machinery as a compact exact inversion for pair2; it passes but is terrible (5,957,442 Toffoli / 3,147q, peak in cmod-add replay). New test `bilinear_invariant_does_not_recover_inverse_branch` also kills the simplest invariant predicate (`r*v+s*u=0`) for self-cleaning reverse. New test `initial_gt_window_classifier_not_approx_good_enough` kills low-bit+one-comparator Kaliski windows (`w=8,t=4` majority error ~60%). Positive test `window_hint_bits_can_compress_history_but_not_select_matrix_alone` shows per-window matrix hints could compress history: t=16 observed max 34 matrices/key => 6 bits/window, 156 total hint bits. New `selected_matrix_application_arithmetic_intensity_model` shows selected matrices are arithmetically dense (t=16 mean 34.94 row-add terms vs 15.73 raw odd-step add/sub count), so any Toffoli win must come from deleting cswaps/comparators/control scaffolds, not fewer arithmetic terms. New `global_window_matrix_indices_do_not_compress_history` shows global matrix ids do not compress history (t=16 sampled 111696 matrices => 17 bits/window, 442 total), so short hints require low-state-keyed QROM. BY update: `jumpdivstep_matrix_arithmetic_intensity_model` gives w=16 mean 11.56 row-add terms/window, 47 exact windows, ~543 terms/pair; `approximate_divstep_cutoff_survey` gives q99=549/q999=555/fail>550≈0.0062, so approximate w=16 can use ~35 windows. `fixed_by_coeff_channel_is_tagged_div_when_converged` proves BY also supports the `y+x` tagged-DIV algebra (`V*x=sign(f)2^K`, `R=0 mod p`, recover `y/x` as `sign*V(y+x)2^-K-1`), with 29/5000 failures at K=550. But deeper circuit modeling blocks the naive jump win: `jump_matrix_depends_on_delta_and_g_over_f_ratio` compresses selection to `(delta,g/f mod 2^w)` (41*2^w keys) but does not solve coherent application; `naive_variable_coefficient_jump_apply_is_too_expensive` gives ~5.2M for quantum coefficient-bit application; `modular_jump_inverse_cleanup_is_dense_dead_end` shows unscaled modular inverse cleanup has mean 4-entry popcount ~814; raw microsteps cost ~3.29M per 550-step tagged DIV; hybrid jumped denominator + microstep tag channel costs ~2.66M; scaled modular sparse cleanup with current primitives still costs ~2.05M for the modular pair. BY is algebraically promising. New batched-shift lead: `batched_halve16_top_bits_recover_correction_with_negligible_exception` validates approximate division by 2^16 via `m=-T*p^-1 mod 2^16`, sparse add of `m*p` (`p=2^256-(2^32+977)`), and top-bit m-uncompute: 0/20000 sampled canonical failures; explicit rare exception T=1 has m=13617/top=13616, probability ~2^48/p. `highfold_then_batched_halve16_matches_row_distribution` validates sampled BY row values after folding k=T>>256 copies of p: 0/40000 failures. `approximate_batched_shift_reopens_scaled_by_jump_budget` measures highfold≈1862 CCX, shift16≈1915 CCX, integer row+cleanup≈6976 CCX, scaled modular pair/window≈18254 CCX after old-row cleanup highfolds, 35 windows≈639k. `approximate_batched_halve16_canonical_circuit_matches_classical` simulates the real canonical batched-shift circuit on 64 random basis states. `windowed_scaled_by_tagged_division_matches_microstep_algebra` validates the full w=16, 35-window scaled BY tagged-DIV algebra: 0/3000 failures at 560 steps, bottom channel zero, output sign(f)*r-1=y/x. Caveat: `noncanonical_batched_shift_needs_quotient_uncompute` shows T and T+p produce the same scaled residue but different correction m, so noncanonical highfold quotient is not output-recoverable. Canonical batched shift is real; noncanonical row highfold must keep/recover quotient or fuse it with cleanup. `low_ratio_window_state_needs_large_rank_history` also kills h-only branch compression: reversing `(delta,h)->(delta',h')` on actual 35-window trajectories needs up to 71769 preimages (17 bits/window), and 16-bit ranks fail ~10.95% of inversions. Carry-slack fix for shifted row adds raises full 3-pair BY cleanup to ≈2852q (over cap) and 2-pair optimistic lower-bound to ≈2304q / ≈575k. Positive row progress: `noncanonical_scaled_pair_map_is_injective_on_canonical_domain` keeps two-row replacement algebraically possible; `fixed_positive_matrix_forward_rows_clean_m_and_match_classical` simulates a positive fixed matrix forward row circuit with m computed/uncomputed from original sources, 8772 CCX peak 1624q. `signed_matrix_forward_rows_clean_m_and_match_twos_complement` extends forward rows to signed matrix [[-8192,24576],[-3,1]] with arithmetic right shift, 5563 CCX / 1624q. `adjugate_m_correction_is_integral_for_sampled_by_matrices` proves sampled general cleanup integrality (`s adj(P)m / 2^w`); `qcorr_roundtrip_recovers_m_for_sampled_by_matrices` proves P*q=m, so m can be uncomputed from q after old rows are zeroed. `positive_triangular_fixed_matrix_replacement_cleans_old_rows` is the first complete fixed-matrix replacement for [[65536,0],[65535,1]]: scaled rows, old-row zeroing via noncanonical adjugate residual, m uncompute from residual high bits, residual uncompute; passes 32 random basis states at 20146 CCX / 1898q. `signed_sample_fixed_matrix_replacement_cleans_old_rows` completes a signed matrix [[-8192,24576],[-3,1]]: signed q=s adj(P)m/2^16, old-row zeroing, m cleared via Pq=m, q cleared from residual high bits; passes 32 random basis states at 13110 CCX / 2224q after freeing unused q sign-extension bits. `fixed_matrix_replacement_sample_cost_distribution` generalizes to arbitrary signed sampled BY matrices: 32 samples mean 20991 CCX, p90 24234, max 28099, peak 2224q. `branch_bits_reconstruct_by_jump_matrix` proves each w=16 BY matrix is exactly reconstructed from the 16 odd/even branch bits plus starting delta; 35 windows need exactly 560 selector bits. `branch_bit_history_by_tagged_div_budget_model` gives 2224 modular peak + 560 branch bits + 16 delta/control = exactly 2800q, no matrix-ID QROM, but branch-bit generation from x remains open. `smith_factorization_reduces_by_window_to_inplace_shifts_and_unimodular_maps` shows naive SNF diagonalizes sampled windows to diag(1,65536) but can produce huge factors (~3.9e13), so plain SNF is not the route. `hermite_factorization_keeps_scaled_by_window_in_place_with_small_coefficients` finds small factors U P V=[[1,e],[0,65536]], |e|<=32768 and max U,V,U^-1,V^-1 coefficient<=65536 on 4096 sampled windows. This gives an algebraic in-place scaled-window route: apply V^-1, batched-shift z0=(z0+e z1)/2^16, apply U^-1, avoiding old+new double-buffer rows. `fixed_hermite_inplace_modular_window_matches_scaled_by_matrix` builds the first actual fixed sample circuit: 34489 CCX, peak 1285q, exact on 32 random basis states. `fixed_hermite_inplace_window_cost_distribution`: 24 samples mean 33715 CCX, p90 43942, max 44179, approx35≈1.18M, max peak 1285q. `fixed_branch_numerator_window_matches_scaled_by_matrix` is better: use the 16 branch bits directly as a fixed numerator microprogram, then halve both rows 16 times; sample 18890 CCX / 1029q exact, 64-sample mean 22883 CCX, p90 27588, max 30913, approx35≈800900, peak 1029q. `quantum_controlled_branch_numerator_replay_is_too_expensive_naively` quantifies the control tax: generic controlled modular adds cost 77728/window≈2.72M for 35 windows. `low_ratio_microstep_update_generates_branch_bits_without_full_denominator` proves branch generation itself is tiny: h=g/f mod 2^t gives branch bit h&1 and updates C:h/2, B:(h+1)/2, A:(h-1)/(2h) mod 2^(t-1), so a 16-bit h+delta generator suffices and branch history is the reversibility payload. Scratch breakthrough confirmed; selected branch-numerator arithmetic is the right shape. `actual_branch_cases_are_not_sparse_enough_for_a_correction_list` kills the simple sparse-A correction idea: actual 560-step trajectories have mean(A,B,C)=(133.5,133.0,293.5), p99_A=154, p999_A=162, so a naive A-position list is ~1540 bits. `selected_replay_budget_requires_more_than_a_signed_mux` sets numeric targets using measured primitives: cmod_add=1280, mod_add=1024, double=halve=255; naive generic controls≈2.72M, ideal signed mux + static A≈1.86M, ideal signed mux + value-proportional A lower bound≈1.28M, fixed-control lower bound≈0.80M. Next work must avoid generic controlled full-width adds via block/value-proportional A handling or low-cost fixed-control history blocks; a signed mux alone is not enough if A is paid at all 560 positions. `enumerated_branch_block_select_explodes_beyond_single_step` kills naive block SELECT: lower bounds including scaling are b=1≈2.576M, b=2≈5.725M, b=3≈15.105M, b=4≈38.436M even before equality/QROM overhead. Block specialization must share algebra between cases, not enumerate case sequences. `signed_mux_controlled_modular_add_works_but_not_enough` implements the shared first-update primitive acc += odd ? (neg ? -a : a) : 0; correct on random basis states, cost 1790 CCX / 1287q vs 2560 for separate cmod_add+cmod_sub, but full static-A replay still≈2.15M, so useful but insufficient without non-static A handling/deeper algebra. `scaled_by_controlled_microstep_matches_all_cases_and_hits_target_cost` is the deeper refactor: use scaled BY steps directly C:(r,s)->(r,s/2), B:(r,(s+r)/2), A:(s,(s-r)/2). Implement A by controlled swap, controlled neg of s, cmod_add s+=r under odd, then halve s. Coherent one-step circuit matches A/B/C on random plus explicit zero basis states; valid A controls canonicalize the temporary p representative after controlled neg. Cost 2046 CCX, peak 1287q, total560≈1,145,760. `scaled_by_controlled_window_matches_jump_matrix` composes a 16-step controlled window for sample matrix [[-8192,24576],[-3,1]], exact on random basis states, cost 32736 CCX / peak 1317q. `scaled_by_controlled_560_scaffold_cost_model_fits_current_cap` instantiates all 560 controlled microsteps with raw odd/A controls: 1,145,760 CCX, peak 2,405q, raw controls=1120; full arithmetic scaffold fits current 2800q cap before history compression. `scaled_by_controlled_560_tagged_div_basis_simulation` sets controls for one sampled converged denominator, starts (r,s)=(0,y+x), simulates the full 1.145M-CCX circuit, verifies bottom channel zero and recovers y/x as sign(f)*r-1. `scaled_by_pattern_history_560_tagged_div_scaffold_reduces_peak` replaces 1120 raw odd/A controls with 560 raw odd-pattern bits plus one 16-bit A scratch window; same 1,145,760 CCX, peak drops to 1,861q and tagged-DIV simulation passes. `inverse_scaled_by_560_cleans_lam_and_writes_product` solves pair2 cleanup conceptually: inverse scaled BY maps (sign*q,0)->(logical 0,q*x), so after tx=Rx-Qx and lam=q=-lambda it cleans lam and writes Ry+Qy=q*tx into ty; naive inverse cost 1,287,440 CCX, peak 2,403q. `inverse_scaled_by_560_negr_frame_recovers_fast_cost` flips sign frame u=-r, making inverse cases C:(u,2s), B:(u,2s+u), A:(u+2s,-u), so it uses cmod_add not cmod_sub and matches forward cost: 1,145,760 CCX, peak 2,405q. Two-fast-replay full schedule now budgets ≈2,637,286 Toffoli before branch generation, below 2.7M. Logical zero may be noncanonical p due to fast controlled neg; canonical cleanup remains. `two_adic_branch_generator_matches_classical_prefix_on_small_width` proves a real 2-adic quantum branch generator works algebraically, but `naive_quantum_branch_generator_would_erase_scaled_by_savings` shows the direct W=560 compute+uncompute generator would be ≈3.23M per denominator / ≈9.03M point-add projected, so the first savings-capable integration must be windowed or triangular, not naive branch generation. `pattern_augmented_low_ratio_state_still_not_forward_complete` kills the simplest h16+pattern window state: next-window h mismatch 66,905/70,000 = 95.58%, so need sliding high 2-adic state/rank payload/consumed denominator. `tapered_2adic_branch_generator_cost_is_still_too_high` measures the principled sliding high-precision per-bit generator: compute=1,004,080 CCX, compute+uncompute per denominator=2,008,160, two denominators=4,016,320, peak 3372q. Env Kaliski cutoff probes also fail phase guard even for tiny reductions (pair1 403 or pair2 400), so truncating current Kaliski is not the shortcut. `window_pattern_and_delta_reconstruct_a_controls` proves A-controls are decoder scratch, not history: a 16-bit odd-pattern plus starting delta reconstructs all A bits and next delta. `pattern_decoder_budget_fits_branch_decode_margin` pessimistically budgets a reversible 10-bit delta decoder at ~41 CCX/step, ~22,960 CCX total, comfortably inside the 150k branch/decode margin. This closes the 2.72M selected-replay blocker in Toffoli; remaining issues are branch-history compression/cleanup, zero-canonical controlled neg, and fitting history+adder workspace into ~600 scratch. `branch_pattern_entropy_supports_compressed_history_target` encodes each 16-step window by its branch pattern: 10k trajectories H≈440.2 bits, p99≈458.5, p999≈462.1, fixed per-window distinct-pattern IDs=481 bits, fail>520=0. This is better than raw 560 branch bits and directly matches the scaled microprogram. Scratch path: no-clean-temp/dirty-workspace controlled add so the ~480-bit history bank covers/overlaps arithmetic workspace instead of adding to it. `compressed_pattern_history_scratch_model_is_600q_if_add_workspace_is_removed`: current local microstep workspace beyond (r,s)=775q, compressed pattern history=481q, A/delta scratch=26q => current additive scratch≈1282q; if controlled add has no clean 256-bit temp / borrows dirty history, target scratch≈597q. Existing venting substrate is promising: `dirty_quantum_offset_adder_is_plausible_cmod_add_substrate` measures iadd_dirty_2clean_qoffset at 762 CCX with only 2 clean + 254 dirty qubits and no hidden clean n-register. Added `ciadd_dirty_3clean_qoffset`: small n=8 basis check passes with dirty restored/phase clean, but n=256 naive controlled qoffset costs 3557 CCX / 770q; scaled BY step would be ~4323 CCX, 560-step replay ~2.42M, too high. Need shared/control-efficient dirty qoffset modular add, not naive control of every qoffset use. `scaled_by_div_point_add_budget_has_sota_margin_if_history_workspace_solved` gives the whole point-add economics: non-inversion scaffold≈942750 + scaled BY DIV 2046*560≈1145760 + 150k branch/decode margin => projected≈2,238,510 Toffoli after deleting both Kaliski invocations, below Google 2.7M and close to 2.1M. `low_scratch_scaled_by_budget_still_beats_27m_after_pair1_mul_deletion` accounts for tagged DIV also deleting pair1's two schoolbook muls (149889+150145): scaffold_after_div≈642716, fast projected≈1,938,476, low-scratch vented BY projected≈2,650,796, so even the higher-Toffoli low-scratch variant beats 2.7M on paper. `actual_matrix_sequence_entropy_supports_sub600_history_target` estimates empirical 35-window matrix-sequence entropy on 10k secp256k1 samples: H≈449 bits, independent-code p99≈463/p999≈465, fail>550=0; this says selector history may fit sub-600 information-theoretically. `by_tagged_div_stored_matrix_upper_bound_model` combines integer denominator replacement + modular fixed-matrix replacement assuming per-window matrices known: mean/window 28607 CCX, p90 35087, max 37609, 35 windows≈1,001,258 CCX, scheduled peak≈2772q, raw selector history≈770 bits. `h_only_compressed_history_by_tagged_div_budget_model` deletes the full denominator pair and keeps only h/delta + compressed matrix history: mean modular window≈19219 CCX, 35 windows≈672650 CCX, mod peak 2224q + 480 history + 32 h/control => peak≈2736q. This is the first sub-1M/sub-2800q BY DIV-shaped model. Next solve reversible entropy-coded matrix history and h-only update/reverse, then assemble BY tagged-DIV scaffold.
- **Strategy C re-estimate at current 407/403 iters is not a win**: extra q×q/q×const muls and Bennett cleanup cost ~2.5M around the single Kaliski; total estimated **~4.2M**, roughly current baseline. It was only attractive against old 511-iter baselines.
- **m_hist formula correction**: iter-START fingerprint gives `m_i`, but iter-END+available flags does not; direct persistent `m_hist` removal is blocked without a new self-cleaning Kaliski body or pebble recomputation.
- **Remaining SOTA route**: either (a) derive clean DIV / coefficient-transform cleanup, or (b) novel jumped/windowed Kaliski reducing per-invocation cost by ~45%. Local arithmetic swaps are now <10% levers.

## 2026-04-27 UNLOCK (partial): classical formula for m_i

**Classically verified on 256,000 random samples** (see
`src/point_add/kaliski_classical_replay.rs`):

```
  m_i = f AND u[0] AND (NOT v_w[0] OR (u > v_w))
```

Zero mismatches across 500 secp256k1 inputs × 512 iters each, FROM
ITER-START STATE. Only 7 of 16 F_min-fingerprint states are reachable;
all are deterministic.

## 2026-04-28 CORRECTION: m_hist elimination blocked by cleanup

**Additional classical test (commit HEAD, `check_iter_end_plus_af_fingerprint`)**:
iter-END state + a_f does NOT determine m_i. 9 conflicts over 256k samples.
The iter-start state determines m_i, but iter-start state is GONE at iter-end
(steps 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 modify u/v/r/s/f destructively).

**Circuit-level implication**: the formula cannot be used as a direct MBU
uncomputation at iter-end, because Gidney MBU needs phase-correction
controls to reference LIVE registers whose values still equal the inputs
that determined the ancilla. Iter-start values of (f, u[0], v[0], gt)
aren't live at iter-end.

**Workarounds that fail**:
- Preserving iter-start values as iter-local shadow qubits: saves 1 bit
  (m_i) but costs 4 bits (shadow). Net WORSE than m_hist itself.
- Uncomputing m_i at backward iter-END: backward iter-END gives iter-START
  state (so formula works), but m_i is needed DURING the body, not at end.
- Global recomputation via fake forward pass inside backward: costs a full
  extra Kaliski forward per backward, +1.6M Toffoli. Kills the savings.

**Status**: m_hist elimination is architecturally harder than initially
claimed. It's NOT an easy win. Keep the formula classically verified in
`kaliski_classical_replay.rs` for future reference, but do NOT treat it as
an actionable Toffoli-savings lever right now.

**What MIGHT work**: reformulate the Kaliski body so that m_i's information
is preserved in OTHER persistent state (e.g. fold m_j into a_f's history,
or encode it into a phase of u/v). This is novel-research territory.

**Corrected consequence**:
- The start-state formula is useful only as a diagnostic for designing a new
  self-cleaning Kaliski/DIV body.
- It is **not** an implementation recipe for deleting `m_hist` in the current
  circuit. Direct porting would require iter-start shadows or a fake forward
  replay and is net worse.
- Keep this line of work only if it is tied to the 600-scratch DIV goal:
  make the iteration branch recoverable from the end-state/output transform,
  not from a stored history register.


## Dead-ends proven in 2026-04-26 session (avoid re-exploring)
- **Single-inversion B2 (any variant)**: 320 phase-batch signature is intrinsic. Fresh-output rewrite gave identical signature. Classical falsification proved no cheap polynomial uncompute of `lam_copy` from live outputs.
- **Direct Kim-drop-in as inversion primitive**: fails classical+phase. Scale/sign mismatch with Kaliski convention.
- **Strategy C (dx³ single inversion)**: probe 4.57M CCX at 4279q. Too wide.
- **Coset on Solinas shift chain**: shift22 cost pays back savings; wide-acc uncompute has no cheap path.
- **cuccaro_sub_fast in schoolbook_mul_into_addsub corrections**: blows peak cap.
- **Non-bulk STEP 4 load-width narrowing**: already narrowed to `min(n, 2n-iter_idx)`.
- **bk_bulk_step4 transform/add-width narrowing**: causes 320 phase batches.
- **Windowed sparse classical-const mul for pair1_halve/pair2_double**: net-negative (prior session).
- **2-level Karatsuba at Kaliski-internal mul sites**: peak over cap (+258q).

## Session 2026-04-26 committed truncation wins

## Priority-1 moonshot: Gidney 2025 venting adder
**The right route to SOTA. Multi-week port.**

Paper: Craig Gidney, "A Classical-Quantum Adder with Constant Workspace and Linear Gates", July 2025 (arXiv:2507.23079). Likely the core primitive underlying Google SOTA.

Key result: classical-quantum add in **3 clean ancillae + 4n Toffolis** (or 2 clean + n-2 dirty, 3n Toffolis). Controlled version has zero extra cost.

Technique: "venting" = measure Z-redundant carry qubits in X basis, leaving phase tasks fixed later via HRS17 carry-xor + classically-controlled Z gates.

**Implementation plan**:
1. Fetch Zenodo Python reference (doi:10.5281/zenodo.15866587).
2. Port streaming-MAJ + venting adder primitive (~400 LOC).
3. Port HRS17 carry-xor primitive for phase fixup.
4. Replace ~34 call sites of `add_nbit_const_fast`/`csub_nbit_const_fast`/`cadd_nbit_const_fast`.
5. Expected impact: peak 2717 → ~2460 (-256q), Toffoli likely net neutral.

**Risk**: phase-bug-prone. The critical circuit diagrams (Figures 2-6) are not in PDF-extracted text; must port from Python code. Without that reference, don't re-derive from paper text alone.

**2026-04-23 port result**: full Zenodo-guided port of the 3-clean venting adder + carry-xor, wired in as a wholesale replacement for `add_nbit_const_fast` / `sub_nbit_const_fast` / `cadd_nbit_const_fast` / `csub_nbit_const_fast`, was **correct and phase-clean** but **net negative** for this benchmark:
- `avg_toffoli`: 4.236M → **5.369M** (**+1.13M** worse)
- qubits: **unchanged at 2717**
- emitted ops: 34.86M → **34.03M** (slightly lower op count, but Toffoli much higher)

**Conclusion**: the current loaded-constant + fast q-q adders are far cheaper in Toffoli than the `4n` venting adder, and the benchmark peak is not currently dominated by these const-add call sites. So the venting adder is **not** a drop-in replacement. If revisited, use it only for a **peak-critical localized path** where wide Cuccaro carry scratch is the bottleneck, not globally.

## Priority-2 moonshot: windowed Montgomery inversion (Gidney-Ekera style)
Targets 1100q. Core primitives:
1. Montgomery form throughout: `x̃ = x·2^n mod p`, `mul_mont(a,b) = a·b·2^{-n} mod p`.
2. Unified Kaliski/Montgomery with 4-bit window per step.
3. Window history ~n/4 = 64 qubits replace our 408-qubit m_hist.
4. Fold one Kaliski register onto input register.

**Estimated budget**: 512 (inputs doubling as Kaliski state) + 256 (aux) + 64 (window) = ~830q. Matches SOTA.

**Implementation complexity**: ~1000 LOC. Multi-week.

## 2026-04-23 literature update: what Google's public paper actually reveals
Source: `arXiv:2603.28846` TeX source + refs, plus latest public Gidney/Litinski papers.

Key public clues from Google/Babbush/Zalcman/Gidney:
- Their **undisclosed improvement is still a point-add circuit**. The ZK proof attests directly to a `secp256k1` point-add circuit, not some different full-ECDLP trick.
- They explicitly say the point-add is a **pure classical reversible boolean function** executed in superposition, with **MBUC** and **windowed arithmetic**. So the win is in the logical circuit itself, not some non-boolean quantum trick.
- Their full ECDLP uses **in-place windowed elliptic-curve point additions**, each with **3 table lookups**, and optimal `w=16` at the published point-add cost.
- Their point-add resource target is approximately **4.5n space**, i.e. **1175 qubits (low-qubit)** or **1425 qubits (low-gate)** at `n=256`.
- They describe windowed arithmetic + MBUC as **common ingredients already present in prior work**. Therefore those are almost certainly **not** the hidden breakthrough by themselves.
- They still cite affine/windowed literature and do **not** signal projective coordinates as the answer. This aligns with `2502.12441`, which explicitly finds projective coordinates worse for Shor/ECDLP.

Implication for this repo:
- We should stop thinking in terms of shaving the current 2-Kaliski affine design.
- The correct target is a **new point-add architecture in the 1175-1425q regime**.
- Any path that cannot plausibly get below ~1500 qubits at point-add level is probably the wrong architecture.

## New Priority-0 direction: unpublished-style compact point-add reconstruction
Working hypothesis from the public clues:
- Google likely did **not** win by a better schoolbook/Karatsuba tweak.
- They likely combined:
  1. a **windowed / lookup-centric point-add skeleton**,
  2. a **much more compact inversion/division core** than our current Kaliski state layout,
  3. aggressive **register folding / history compression**, and
  4. MBUC everywhere phase-clean.

Most plausible public reconstruction bets:
- **Bet A: compact windowed-Montgomery inverse / divstep family**
  - Replace 408-bit `m_hist` with ~64-ish window history.
  - Reuse input/output registers as inverse state.
  - This is the only public-ish line that plausibly lands near 1175q.
- **Bet B: lookup-structured point-add, not generic affine arithmetic**
  - Recast the add around signed-window / table-selected classical points and their shared structure.
  - Optimize for the actual `Q <- P[k] + Q` workload instead of a generic classical-point add primitive.
- **Bet C: approximate / test-set exactness where Shor permits it**
  - Google only proves 9024 Fiat-Shamir-derived test vectors plus the usual Shor tolerance argument.
  - Harness still needs exact correctness on its tests, but this suggests carefully targeted approximations may be acceptable if they stay inside the harness acceptance set.

Near-term implementation consequence:
- The next serious moonshot is **not** another local adder swap.
- It is a **new low-qubit point-add scaffold** whose first milestone is: bring peak qubits under ~1800 even before beating Toffoli.

## 2026-04-24 deep research update: exact reversible point-add only (`src/main.rs` target)
Scope reminder: `src/main.rs` tests an **exact reversible map**
`(Px, Py; Qx, Qy_classical) -> (Rx, Ry)`
on random secp256k1 points, with all ancillas returned to zero. This rules out several low-qubit ECDLP tricks that only compute compressed predicates or only work inside a larger period-finding scaffold.

### Most relevant public results
- **Google/Babbush/Gidney 2026 (`2603.28846`)**
  - Publicly reveals only that their hidden circuit is still a **kickmix / classical reversible point-add** with **MBUC** and **windowed arithmetic**.
  - ZK statements certify exact point-add resource bounds of:
    - **low-qubit:** `2.7M` non-Clifford, `1175` qubits, `17M` ops
    - **low-gate:** `2.1M` non-Clifford, `1425` qubits, `17M` ops
  - Strong clue: any plausible reconstruction must live in the **1175-1425q** regime, i.e. only **~660-910 ancilla qubits beyond the 512 data qubits**.
- **Chevignard–Fouque–Schrottenloher 2026**
  - Uses **RNS + projective coordinates + Legendre-symbol compression** to hit **1098 qubits**.
  - But it does **not** output exact affine point addition; it compresses the output to one bit and pays `~2^38.1` Toffolis. So it is **not applicable** to the `main.rs` exact point-add benchmark.
- **Kim et al. 2026**
  - Best public recent work directly on ECC point-add structure.
  - Uses **Montgomery multiplication**, **binary EEA inversion**, **unconditional execution**, **borrowed ancilla from following multiplication**, and **windowed point addition with 3 signed lookups**.
  - Main emphasis is **depth**, not low Toffoli or low qubits. Useful as a source of structural ideas, not as a target architecture.
- **Häner et al. 2020 (HRSL)**
  - Still the key public affine baseline for exact reversible point addition.
  - Important ideas: **windowed Montgomery multiplication**, **swap-based Kaliski formulation**, **adaptive uncompute placement**.
  - But published resource point is far from Google SOTA.
- **Litinski 2024 schoolbook add-subtract multiplier**
  - Already exploited here. Valuable for q×q multipliers, but not enough alone.
- **Gidney 2025 venting adder**
  - Great for q+c additions under tight workspace.
  - Proven here to be **wrong as a global drop-in** for this benchmark.
- **Luongo–Narasimhachar–Sireesh 2025 / Gidney 2019 windowed arithmetic**
  - Best public techniques for **lookup-heavy q+c arithmetic**.
  - Relevant only if the point-add is redesigned around more lookup / q+c structure and less generic q×q arithmetic.

### Hard conclusion from the literature
For the exact `main.rs` benchmark, the public field points to this:
- **Projective-coordinate / Legendre / RNS compression is a red herring** for us, because it does not produce exact `(Rx, Ry)`.
- **Depth-first QCSA / Kim-style circuits are not the answer** unless we can also compress space dramatically.
- **Generic affine 2-Kaliski with full history is architecturally doomed** for SOTA because the persistent state already exceeds the entire ancilla budget implied by Google's qubit count.

### Best plausible exact-benchmark reconstruction path
A new exact reversible point-add circuit that plausibly reaches SOTA should aim for:
1. **At most 2-3 extra n-bit registers live at once**
   - Since `main.rs` fixes 512 data qubits, the Google low-qubit target allows only ~663 extra qubits.
   - That is consistent with **two extra 256-bit registers + ~150 bits**, or at most **three extra 256-bit registers** in the low-gate variant.
2. **One compact inversion/division core, not today's 4-register Kaliski state**
   - Need to replace `(u, v, r, s, m_hist)` with something like:
     - input/output register reuse,
     - 1-2 coefficient registers,
     - short window history (`~64` bits), or
     - an implicit / recomputed history strategy that does not blow Toffoli too badly.
3. **Montgomery-form arithmetic throughout the point-add body**
   - Not just swapping multiplier internals.
   - The point-add scaffold itself must be arranged so conversions do not eat the gain.
4. **Lookup-centric exact arithmetic where the classical point helps**
   - Public windowed-arithmetic advances only help if we deliberately increase the fraction of q+c / lookup work.
5. **Exact end-to-end cleanup compatible with `main.rs`**
   - Any trick that only proves a compressed predicate or only works inside the final ECDLP scaffold is out of scope.

### Concrete redesign candidates worth building
- **Candidate A (highest priority): compact Montgomery-inverse scaffold for exact affine add**
  - Goal: replace current Kaliski state with a **register-folded**, window-history inversion core.
  - Success criterion: same exact interface, but peak qubits under ~1800 first, then attack Toffolis.
- **Candidate B: HRSL/Kim-style swap-based inversion with aggressive register borrowing**
  - Borrow ancilla from multiplication / later phases instead of owning it persistently.
  - Likely lower depth than current code, but must be adapted for qubit minimization.
- **Candidate C: exact benchmark-specific lookup-heavy add skeleton**
  - Re-express the classical-point add around identities that maximize q+c work and minimize q×q work.
  - This is the only route where Ragavan/Gidney/Luongo-style lookup optimizations become material.

### Immediate next implementation principle
Do **not** spend more time tuning the existing affine/Kaliski scaffold.
The right first code milestone is a **fresh point-add scaffold file/branch** whose first target is:
- **peak qubits < 1800**
- while still satisfying `src/main.rs` exact reversible contract.

## Priority-3 moonshot: Kim 2026 unconditional Kaliski
Eliminates m_hist (-409q). Case computed from state each iter, not stored.
- Cost: +9-28% Toffoli per literature.
- Net 2718 → ~2310 qubits. Insufficient alone, but stacks with other moves.

## Known dead ends (don't re-attempt)
- **Montgomery batched inversion** (`c = dx·N` trick): cleanup requires 2nd Kaliski, net zero savings. Proven.
- **Bernstein-Yang divsteps (all w)**: per-iter cost × iter count ≥ Kaliski at every window width.
- **Jacobian coordinates**: same cleanup obstruction as Montgomery batched.
- **Naive Karatsuba in-Kaliski**: exceeds 2800 qubit cap (peak jumps to ~2996).
- **HRSL cumulative swap state**: +3.2M Toffoli, dead end.
- **Toom-3 / Fermat / Edwards-coord swap**: analyzed and rejected.

## Moonshot progress: single-Kaliski point-add
- **Stage 1 (classical math)**: DONE. `single_inv_numeric::single_inv_add` /
  `single_inv_add_skip_inv_dx` pass 200/200 trials vs reference. Formula for
  a single-inversion affine add IS correct.
- **Stage 1.5 (reversibility scan)**: DONE. The naive scaffold hits a wall:
  going from `ty = dy` to `ty = Ry` via `ty −= λ*tx` leaves `Py + Ry` in ty,
  and Py is quantum. Resolutions: (i) 2-Kaliski status quo; (ii) Bennett
  output register for Ry at +n persistent qubits; (iii) use a 2ⁿⁿ-style
  scale-factor trick to flip the sign. See `single_inv_plan.md` for details.
- **Stage 1.75 (replay existing scaffold)**: PARTIAL. Tried to reproduce
  current build()'s (Rx, Ry) by classical simulation under various scale
  conventions; none matched with naive `E = 2n`, `E = iters`, or simple
  combos. Conclusion: **Kaliski's exponent K is NOT pair_iters**. K is the
  termination iteration index, which is input-dependent (typically
  ~256–270 for secp256k1). The existing build() relies on the exact K and
  the pair_halve/pair_double loops cancel it into `1` on the nose for every
  shot. To port into a single-Kaliski scaffold, the replay must either:
    - reproduce the input-dependent K exactly, or
    - unify pair1 + pair2 into a combined halve/double schedule that cancels K.
  This is solvable but requires reading `kaliski_iteration` semantics more
  carefully than this session got to.

## Negative results from this session (don't re-explore without new info)
- **`mod_mul_write_into_zero_acc_schoolbook_lowq` at pair1_mul1**: deterministic phase-garbage (1 batch in 1/20480 shots, ALT_SEED tag=5, reproducible across two runs). The forward+inverse pair is in principle phase-clean (it is a gate-level inverse of a gate-level inverse), but as a drop-in replacement for the schoolbook mul inside the Kaliski body it breaks the phase contract. Microbench confirms peak is NOT reduced by the lowq substitution (both variants are 1797 at n=256) — the 2n=512 tmp_ext dominates. Kept the helper as `#[allow(dead_code)]` with a note, since the negative result is important data for the next structural move.
- **`KAL_FREE_S`** (free `st.s` after `kaliski_forward`, reallocate before `kaliski_backward`): catastrophic phase failure (64/64 batches across all seeds). Disproves the naive assumption that `st.s = 1` post-forward in the point-add scaffold; actual value must depend on the iter-at-termination per-shot. Any freeing of `st.s` requires measuring/remembering the actual final value classically, which collapses superposition — not viable inside a Kaliski body that must be reversible around the next body step.
- **Karatsuba-1 at `pair1_mul2`**: blocked by the 2800q cap (persistent 2205 + 772 transient = 2977). Freeing one full n-wide persistent register (u/v_w/s/m_hist) before the site is a prerequisite, and only `m_hist` has an even theoretically phase-clean compression path. See ideas below.

## Microbench findings (src/point_add/microbench.rs, `MICROBENCH=1 cargo test ...`)
Measured local peak + Toffoli of isolated primitives at n=256 from commit 9509e82:

| primitive                          | toffoli | peak qubits |
|------------------------------------|--------:|------------:|
| schoolbook (write/add)             | ~153k   | **1797**    |
| karatsuba-1 (write/add)            | ~125k   | 2055        |
| karatsuba-1 lowq (non-fast inner)  | 228k    | 2055        |
| karatsuba-2 (write/add)            | ~114k   | 2315        |
| schoolbook_addsub forward (fast)   |  67k    | 1283        |
| schoolbook_addsub forward (lowq)   | 133k    | 1283        |

Key implications:
- schoolbook→karatsuba-1 is `-28k Toffoli, +258 peak`. The +258 is exactly the outer `2n` tmp_ext of karatsuba_forward, NOT Cuccaro carries.
- Replacing fast carries with non-fast carries (`lowq` variants) does NOT reduce peak of karatsuba-1 below fast karatsuba-1. So "low-q Cuccaro inside the Kaliski-body mul" is NOT a real qubit lever.
- Any path that gets karatsuba Toffoli gains under the 2800q cap must either (a) shrink the 2n tmp_ext itself, or (b) shrink persistent state (m_hist / lam / Kaliski registers) before the mul.
- Single-site karatsuba-1 at pair1_mul2 or pair2_mul saves 28k but pushes peak to ~2972 (over cap).
- Lowering pair iter count is on a phase cliff (pair1_iters=406 and pair2_iters=403 fail 24-seed gate).

SOTA path implication (n=256, target ~1175-1425 qubits):
- The structural bottleneck is the 2n=512 tmp_ext bulge stacked on top of ~2200 persistent Kaliski state. Closing the SOTA gap requires eliminating one full n-wide persistent register (m_hist compression, Kim unconditional without m_hist, or folding lam into an output register) AND compressing the mul tmp_ext at the same time. Small isolated substitutions cannot cross the qubit cap.

## Structural lever that would actually break the 2800q cap
Single most-promising: **m_hist compression via measurement**. m_hist is a
407-wide qubit register that is write-only inside `kaliski_iteration` and
read-only inside `kaliski_iteration_backward`. If m_hist[i] becomes a
classical (Z-basis) eigenstate after its producing forward iteration, it
could be projected into a classical BitId via a Z-measurement + reset,
saving up to 407 persistent qubits (more than enough to pay for one or
two karatsuba-1 substitutions + their transients).

Blockers found this session:
- The circuit IR has no Z-basis `Measure` op. Only `Hmr` exists, and `Hmr`
  samples in the X basis — it gives a random classical bit even when the
  qubit is in a Z eigenstate, which breaks the phase contract.
- The CX copy `cx(m_i_qubit → m_i_bit)` cannot be emitted because `BitId`
  is not a valid CX target; `x_if` / `cx_if` / `bit_store1_if` all take a
  BitId as the condition, never as the target.
- A workaround via `BitStore1_if(m_i_qubit?)` does not exist either.
- Kim-style unconditional Kaliski would eliminate `m_hist` entirely at a
  +9–28% Toffoli cost, which overshoots our current 4.18M Toffoli by more
  than we'd claw back from karatsuba swaps. Only worth doing if the qubit
  budget is the binding constraint (e.g. when chasing the 1175q regime).

Next moves worth trying (roughly in order of easiest/most-likely):
1. Add a `Measure` op (Z-basis) to the IR + sim + inverter. Small change.
   Then implement m_hist compression as `qubit → BitId after iter i`,
   and update `kaliski_iteration_backward` to accept `m_i: BitId` and use
   `cx_if` / `x_if` / `ccx_if` everywhere m_i was a read-only control.
2. With m_hist compressed, try karatsuba-1 at pair1_mul2 and pair2_mul.
   Microbench says each saves ~28k Toffoli at +258 peak; together that's
   ~56k Toffoli on top of the ~40k bit-compression bonus.
3. Karatsuba2 at pair1_mul2 after step (1) may also fit (+518 peak with
   ~407 qubits newly free). Another ~11k Toffoli on top.

## Session-scale wins still possible (~50-200q, tens-of-k Toffoli)
- **In-place step4 (eliminate tmp via Gidney measurement-AND)**: -256q at +~800k Toffoli. Needs careful HMR matching.
- **Non-fast Cuccaro everywhere at peak**: -255q at +~300k Toffoli. Needs unified fwd/bwd variants.
- **Asymmetric pair iter tuning**: probably tapped out at 408/405.

## Latent bug notes
- **bulk_prefix_backward r[255]=1** bug was fixed in commit 351c0f7 (2026-04-23).
- **HMR ID-reorder sensitivity**: some phase corrections still depend on specific qubit-ID RNG alignment. Not currently manifesting, but fragile. Investigate if hit again.
