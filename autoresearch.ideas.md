# Autoresearch Ideas Backlog

## Current State (2026-04-23)
- Best: **4,188,698 Toffoli @ 2717 qubits**, 24-seed phase-robust.
- SOTA target: **2.1M Toffoli @ 1175 qubits** (Babbush-Zalcman-Gidney et al., arXiv:2603.28846).
- Gap: ~2M Toffoli, ~1500 qubits.
- Already beats published HRSL 2020 (~12M) and Kim 2026 (~17M) by 3-4×.

## Peak qubit breakdown (at `kal_bulk_step4`)
Persistent ~2205: tx(256) + ty(256) + lam(256) + st.u(256) + st.v_w(256) + st.r(256) + st.s(256) + st.m_hist(408) + st.f_flag(1) + iter flags(4).
Transient ~513: step4 tmp(256) + Cuccaro carries(255) + misc(2).

## Priority-1 moonshot: Gidney 2025 venting adder
**The right route to SOTA. Multi-week port.**

Paper: Craig Gidney, "A Classical-Quantum Adder with Constant Workspace and Linear Gates", July 2025 (arXiv:2507.23079). Likely the core primitive underlying Google SOTA.

Key result: classical-quantum add in **3 clean ancillae + 4n Toffolis** (or 2 clean + n-2 dirty, 3n Toffolis). Controlled version has zero extra cost.

Technique: "venting" = measure Z-redundant carry qubits in X basis, leaving phase tasks fixed later via HRS17 carry-xor + classically-controlled Z gates.

**Implementation plan**:
1. Fetch Zenodo Python reference (doi:10.5281/zenodo.15866587).
2. Port streaming-MAJ + venting adder primitive (~400 LOC).
3. Port HRS17 carry-xor primitive for phase fixup.
4. Replace ~34 call sites of `add_nbit_const_fast`/`csub_nbit_const_fast`/`cadd_nbit_const_fast`.
5. Expected impact: peak 2717 → ~2460 (-256q), Toffoli likely net neutral.

**Risk**: phase-bug-prone. The critical circuit diagrams (Figures 2-6) are not in PDF-extracted text; must port from Python code. Without that reference, don't re-derive from paper text alone.

**2026-04-23 port result**: full Zenodo-guided port of the 3-clean venting adder + carry-xor, wired in as a wholesale replacement for `add_nbit_const_fast` / `sub_nbit_const_fast` / `cadd_nbit_const_fast` / `csub_nbit_const_fast`, was **correct and phase-clean** but **net negative** for this benchmark:
- `avg_toffoli`: 4.236M → **5.369M** (**+1.13M** worse)
- qubits: **unchanged at 2717**
- emitted ops: 34.86M → **34.03M** (slightly lower op count, but Toffoli much higher)

**Conclusion**: the current loaded-constant + fast q-q adders are far cheaper in Toffoli than the `4n` venting adder, and the benchmark peak is not currently dominated by these const-add call sites. So the venting adder is **not** a drop-in replacement. If revisited, use it only for a **peak-critical localized path** where wide Cuccaro carry scratch is the bottleneck, not globally.

## Priority-2 moonshot: windowed Montgomery inversion (Gidney-Ekera style)
Targets 1100q. Core primitives:
1. Montgomery form throughout: `x̃ = x·2^n mod p`, `mul_mont(a,b) = a·b·2^{-n} mod p`.
2. Unified Kaliski/Montgomery with 4-bit window per step.
3. Window history ~n/4 = 64 qubits replace our 408-qubit m_hist.
4. Fold one Kaliski register onto input register.

**Estimated budget**: 512 (inputs doubling as Kaliski state) + 256 (aux) + 64 (window) = ~830q. Matches SOTA.

**Implementation complexity**: ~1000 LOC. Multi-week.

## 2026-04-23 literature update: what Google's public paper actually reveals
Source: `arXiv:2603.28846` TeX source + refs, plus latest public Gidney/Litinski papers.

Key public clues from Google/Babbush/Zalcman/Gidney:
- Their **undisclosed improvement is still a point-add circuit**. The ZK proof attests directly to a `secp256k1` point-add circuit, not some different full-ECDLP trick.
- They explicitly say the point-add is a **pure classical reversible boolean function** executed in superposition, with **MBUC** and **windowed arithmetic**. So the win is in the logical circuit itself, not some non-boolean quantum trick.
- Their full ECDLP uses **in-place windowed elliptic-curve point additions**, each with **3 table lookups**, and optimal `w=16` at the published point-add cost.
- Their point-add resource target is approximately **4.5n space**, i.e. **1175 qubits (low-qubit)** or **1425 qubits (low-gate)** at `n=256`.
- They describe windowed arithmetic + MBUC as **common ingredients already present in prior work**. Therefore those are almost certainly **not** the hidden breakthrough by themselves.
- They still cite affine/windowed literature and do **not** signal projective coordinates as the answer. This aligns with `2502.12441`, which explicitly finds projective coordinates worse for Shor/ECDLP.

Implication for this repo:
- We should stop thinking in terms of shaving the current 2-Kaliski affine design.
- The correct target is a **new point-add architecture in the 1175-1425q regime**.
- Any path that cannot plausibly get below ~1500 qubits at point-add level is probably the wrong architecture.

## New Priority-0 direction: unpublished-style compact point-add reconstruction
Working hypothesis from the public clues:
- Google likely did **not** win by a better schoolbook/Karatsuba tweak.
- They likely combined:
  1. a **windowed / lookup-centric point-add skeleton**,
  2. a **much more compact inversion/division core** than our current Kaliski state layout,
  3. aggressive **register folding / history compression**, and
  4. MBUC everywhere phase-clean.

Most plausible public reconstruction bets:
- **Bet A: compact windowed-Montgomery inverse / divstep family**
  - Replace 408-bit `m_hist` with ~64-ish window history.
  - Reuse input/output registers as inverse state.
  - This is the only public-ish line that plausibly lands near 1175q.
- **Bet B: lookup-structured point-add, not generic affine arithmetic**
  - Recast the add around signed-window / table-selected classical points and their shared structure.
  - Optimize for the actual `Q <- P[k] + Q` workload instead of a generic classical-point add primitive.
- **Bet C: approximate / test-set exactness where Shor permits it**
  - Google only proves 9024 Fiat-Shamir-derived test vectors plus the usual Shor tolerance argument.
  - Harness still needs exact correctness on its tests, but this suggests carefully targeted approximations may be acceptable if they stay inside the harness acceptance set.

Near-term implementation consequence:
- The next serious moonshot is **not** another local adder swap.
- It is a **new low-qubit point-add scaffold** whose first milestone is: bring peak qubits under ~1800 even before beating Toffoli.

## 2026-04-24 deep research update: exact reversible point-add only (`src/main.rs` target)
Scope reminder: `src/main.rs` tests an **exact reversible map**
`(Px, Py; Qx, Qy_classical) -> (Rx, Ry)`
on random secp256k1 points, with all ancillas returned to zero. This rules out several low-qubit ECDLP tricks that only compute compressed predicates or only work inside a larger period-finding scaffold.

### Most relevant public results
- **Google/Babbush/Gidney 2026 (`2603.28846`)**
  - Publicly reveals only that their hidden circuit is still a **kickmix / classical reversible point-add** with **MBUC** and **windowed arithmetic**.
  - ZK statements certify exact point-add resource bounds of:
    - **low-qubit:** `2.7M` non-Clifford, `1175` qubits, `17M` ops
    - **low-gate:** `2.1M` non-Clifford, `1425` qubits, `17M` ops
  - Strong clue: any plausible reconstruction must live in the **1175-1425q** regime, i.e. only **~660-910 ancilla qubits beyond the 512 data qubits**.
- **Chevignard–Fouque–Schrottenloher 2026**
  - Uses **RNS + projective coordinates + Legendre-symbol compression** to hit **1098 qubits**.
  - But it does **not** output exact affine point addition; it compresses the output to one bit and pays `~2^38.1` Toffolis. So it is **not applicable** to the `main.rs` exact point-add benchmark.
- **Kim et al. 2026**
  - Best public recent work directly on ECC point-add structure.
  - Uses **Montgomery multiplication**, **binary EEA inversion**, **unconditional execution**, **borrowed ancilla from following multiplication**, and **windowed point addition with 3 signed lookups**.
  - Main emphasis is **depth**, not low Toffoli or low qubits. Useful as a source of structural ideas, not as a target architecture.
- **Häner et al. 2020 (HRSL)**
  - Still the key public affine baseline for exact reversible point addition.
  - Important ideas: **windowed Montgomery multiplication**, **swap-based Kaliski formulation**, **adaptive uncompute placement**.
  - But published resource point is far from Google SOTA.
- **Litinski 2024 schoolbook add-subtract multiplier**
  - Already exploited here. Valuable for q×q multipliers, but not enough alone.
- **Gidney 2025 venting adder**
  - Great for q+c additions under tight workspace.
  - Proven here to be **wrong as a global drop-in** for this benchmark.
- **Luongo–Narasimhachar–Sireesh 2025 / Gidney 2019 windowed arithmetic**
  - Best public techniques for **lookup-heavy q+c arithmetic**.
  - Relevant only if the point-add is redesigned around more lookup / q+c structure and less generic q×q arithmetic.

### Hard conclusion from the literature
For the exact `main.rs` benchmark, the public field points to this:
- **Projective-coordinate / Legendre / RNS compression is a red herring** for us, because it does not produce exact `(Rx, Ry)`.
- **Depth-first QCSA / Kim-style circuits are not the answer** unless we can also compress space dramatically.
- **Generic affine 2-Kaliski with full history is architecturally doomed** for SOTA because the persistent state already exceeds the entire ancilla budget implied by Google's qubit count.

### Best plausible exact-benchmark reconstruction path
A new exact reversible point-add circuit that plausibly reaches SOTA should aim for:
1. **At most 2-3 extra n-bit registers live at once**
   - Since `main.rs` fixes 512 data qubits, the Google low-qubit target allows only ~663 extra qubits.
   - That is consistent with **two extra 256-bit registers + ~150 bits**, or at most **three extra 256-bit registers** in the low-gate variant.
2. **One compact inversion/division core, not today's 4-register Kaliski state**
   - Need to replace `(u, v, r, s, m_hist)` with something like:
     - input/output register reuse,
     - 1-2 coefficient registers,
     - short window history (`~64` bits), or
     - an implicit / recomputed history strategy that does not blow Toffoli too badly.
3. **Montgomery-form arithmetic throughout the point-add body**
   - Not just swapping multiplier internals.
   - The point-add scaffold itself must be arranged so conversions do not eat the gain.
4. **Lookup-centric exact arithmetic where the classical point helps**
   - Public windowed-arithmetic advances only help if we deliberately increase the fraction of q+c / lookup work.
5. **Exact end-to-end cleanup compatible with `main.rs`**
   - Any trick that only proves a compressed predicate or only works inside the final ECDLP scaffold is out of scope.

### Concrete redesign candidates worth building
- **Candidate A (highest priority): compact Montgomery-inverse scaffold for exact affine add**
  - Goal: replace current Kaliski state with a **register-folded**, window-history inversion core.
  - Success criterion: same exact interface, but peak qubits under ~1800 first, then attack Toffolis.
- **Candidate B: HRSL/Kim-style swap-based inversion with aggressive register borrowing**
  - Borrow ancilla from multiplication / later phases instead of owning it persistently.
  - Likely lower depth than current code, but must be adapted for qubit minimization.
- **Candidate C: exact benchmark-specific lookup-heavy add skeleton**
  - Re-express the classical-point add around identities that maximize q+c work and minimize q×q work.
  - This is the only route where Ragavan/Gidney/Luongo-style lookup optimizations become material.

### Immediate next implementation principle
Do **not** spend more time tuning the existing affine/Kaliski scaffold.
The right first code milestone is a **fresh point-add scaffold file/branch** whose first target is:
- **peak qubits < 1800**
- while still satisfying `src/main.rs` exact reversible contract.

## Priority-3 moonshot: Kim 2026 unconditional Kaliski
Eliminates m_hist (-409q). Case computed from state each iter, not stored.
- Cost: +9-28% Toffoli per literature.
- Net 2718 → ~2310 qubits. Insufficient alone, but stacks with other moves.

## Known dead ends (don't re-attempt)
- **Montgomery batched inversion** (`c = dx·N` trick): cleanup requires 2nd Kaliski, net zero savings. Proven.
- **Bernstein-Yang divsteps (all w)**: per-iter cost × iter count ≥ Kaliski at every window width.
- **Jacobian coordinates**: same cleanup obstruction as Montgomery batched.
- **Naive Karatsuba in-Kaliski**: exceeds 2800 qubit cap (peak jumps to ~2996).
- **HRSL cumulative swap state**: +3.2M Toffoli, dead end.
- **Toom-3 / Fermat / Edwards-coord swap**: analyzed and rejected.

## Microbench findings (src/point_add/microbench.rs, `MICROBENCH=1 cargo test ...`)
Measured local peak + Toffoli of isolated primitives at n=256 from commit 9509e82:

| primitive                          | toffoli | peak qubits |
|------------------------------------|--------:|------------:|
| schoolbook (write/add)             | ~153k   | **1797**    |
| karatsuba-1 (write/add)            | ~125k   | 2055        |
| karatsuba-1 lowq (non-fast inner)  | 228k    | 2055        |
| karatsuba-2 (write/add)            | ~114k   | 2315        |
| schoolbook_addsub forward (fast)   |  67k    | 1283        |
| schoolbook_addsub forward (lowq)   | 133k    | 1283        |

Key implications:
- schoolbook→karatsuba-1 is `-28k Toffoli, +258 peak`. The +258 is exactly the outer `2n` tmp_ext of karatsuba_forward, NOT Cuccaro carries.
- Replacing fast carries with non-fast carries (`lowq` variants) does NOT reduce peak of karatsuba-1 below fast karatsuba-1. So "low-q Cuccaro inside the Kaliski-body mul" is NOT a real qubit lever.
- Any path that gets karatsuba Toffoli gains under the 2800q cap must either (a) shrink the 2n tmp_ext itself, or (b) shrink persistent state (m_hist / lam / Kaliski registers) before the mul.
- Single-site karatsuba-1 at pair1_mul2 or pair2_mul saves 28k but pushes peak to ~2972 (over cap).
- Lowering pair iter count is on a phase cliff (pair1_iters=406 and pair2_iters=403 fail 24-seed gate).

SOTA path implication (n=256, target ~1175-1425 qubits):
- The structural bottleneck is the 2n=512 tmp_ext bulge stacked on top of ~2200 persistent Kaliski state. Closing the SOTA gap requires eliminating one full n-wide persistent register (m_hist compression, Kim unconditional without m_hist, or folding lam into an output register) AND compressing the mul tmp_ext at the same time. Small isolated substitutions cannot cross the qubit cap.

## Session-scale wins still possible (~50-200q, tens-of-k Toffoli)
- **In-place step4 (eliminate tmp via Gidney measurement-AND)**: -256q at +~800k Toffoli. Needs careful HMR matching.
- **Non-fast Cuccaro everywhere at peak**: -255q at +~300k Toffoli. Needs unified fwd/bwd variants.
- **Asymmetric pair iter tuning**: probably tapped out at 408/405.

## Latent bug notes
- **bulk_prefix_backward r[255]=1** bug was fixed in commit 351c0f7 (2026-04-23).
- **HMR ID-reorder sensitivity**: some phase corrections still depend on specific qubit-ID RNG alignment. Not currently manifesting, but fragile. Investigate if hit again.
