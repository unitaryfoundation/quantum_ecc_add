#   1. Wipe stale ops.bin / score.json so a contestant cannot pre-seed them.
#   2. Run build_circuit (UNTRUSTED — runs contestant code in src/point_add)
#      in its own process group; on exit, kill the whole group so a forked
#      child cannot survive and overwrite score.json after step 4.
#   3. Verify ops.bin exists. If build_circuit exited early or crashed,
#      the file is missing and we fail closed.
#   4. Run eval_circuit (TRUSTED — never imports contestant code) which
#      re-simulates the op stream, validates correctness/reversibility/
#      phase, and writes the canonical score.json.
#
# All command-line arguments are forwarded to eval_circuit (e.g. --note ...).
